# Description: The public use microdata area metropolitan status that the dwelling unit is located.
# Source: 2019-5yrs Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). IPUMS USA, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org.
# Assumption: 'PUMA Metro Status', derived from ACS IPUMS METRO codes, indicates whether the household resided within a metropolitan area and, for households in metropolitan areas, whether the household resided within or outside of a central/principal city. Each PUMA has a unique METRO status in ACS and therefore has a unique PUMA Metro Status. IPUMS derives METRO codes for samples not directly identified based on available geographic information and whether the associated county group or PUMA lies wholly or only partially within metropolitan areas or principal cities.
